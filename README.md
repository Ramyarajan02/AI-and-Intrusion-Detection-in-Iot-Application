# üö® AI-Based Intrusion Detection in IoT Applications

This project focuses on enhancing the security of **IoT (Internet of Things)** networks through **Artificial Intelligence-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**. By leveraging **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** techniques, we aim to detect and classify network intrusions in real-time across multiple benchmark datasets.

## üîí Project Overview

With the rapid proliferation of IoT devices, cybersecurity risks have grown significantly. Traditional security solutions are often ineffective due to the lightweight and resource-constrained nature of IoT environments. This project proposes **AI-powered IDS models** that are accurate, efficient, and suitable for IoT ecosystems.
